							<h3></h3>
							<p>I'm the Project Support Officer for the Jeremiah Horrocks Institute at the University of Central Lancashire. Officially, my job is to administrate workstations on the JHI's linux network, provide data analysis for bespoke projects  and coordinate our annual contribution to the Lancashire Science Festival. But really? I solve problems.</p> 
							<p>The largest of these roles is the continued maintenance and development of the Starlink Network - a suite of linux-based computers, running specialist software for the academics and students of the JHI. As part of the Starlink Manager Team, I'm responsible for all our deployed CentOS workstations, and ensure that they're tailored to the individual needs of their users.</p>

<p>I've recently joined a departmental self-assessment team, where I'm using my data analysis skills to complete an application for a nationally recognised award in the HE sector.</p> 

<p>I'm also heavily involved in the JHI's Outreach & Engagement efforts, bringing our specialist scientific knowledge to fun and educational events for school groups and the public. As the JHI's Lead Co-ordinator for the Lancashire Science Festival, I planned, prepared and delivered the Physical Sciences Zone which included a variety of experiments, activities and demonstrations across Maths, Physics and Astronomy.</p>

							<p>I completed my Ph.D. in Solar Physics in 2018, focussing on the topology of the magnetic field in the solar corona. As part of this work, we provided a definition for a new topological feature, the Null-like Point (paper in progress), along with developing an algorithm for the automatic detection, tracking and analysis of X-ray Bright Points. I also lead a variety of outreach activities as a STEM ambassador.</p>
